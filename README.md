📌 About This Project
This repository contains an implementation of an online shop backend application. The project was initially provided as a practice exercise, where we were given a predefined structure with method placeholders.
The task was to implement the functionality within specific methods, such as start() and printMenuHeader(), to complete the required features.

This project was part of a learning exercise, and the instructor allowed us to share our solutions on GitHub.

⚠️ Disclaimer
This project was completed as part of a learning exercise. The base structure was provided as part of the practice,
and I implemented the missing functionality. While I have tested and reviewed my work, there may still be areas for improvement.
