📌 About This Project
This repository contains an implementation of an online shop backend application. The project was initially provided as a practice exercise, where we were given a predefined structure with method placeholders.
The task was to implement the functionality within specific methods, such as start() and printMenuHeader(), to complete the required features.

🚀 Features Implemented
User Management: Implemented functionality in DefaultUserManagementService.

Sign-Up Process: Completed the SignUpMenu to allow user registration and other menu logic.

Entities: Added properties in entities like DefaultUser and DefaultOrder, and added functionality to
processes that use them.

Backend Logic: Enhanced and filled in key methods to complete the application workflow.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Java OOP

⚠️ Disclaimer
This project was completed as part of a learning exercise. The base structure was provided as part of the practice,
and I implemented the missing functionality. While I have tested and reviewed my work, there may still be areas for improvement.
Feedback and suggestions are welcome!
